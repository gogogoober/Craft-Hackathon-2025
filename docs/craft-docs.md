# Craft – API for GoGoFramework

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview
The Craft Blocks API provides a flexible, hierarchical data structure that serves as a powerful general-purpose hybrid data store. It combines structured data collections with unstructured textual or file block content in a tree-based hierarchy.

## Recommended Usage
This API is best utilized when a custom abstraction layer is built on top to hide Craft-specific concepts (ids, blocks, pages, text styles) and expose domain-specific operations for your use case.

## Development Tip
- When working with existing content, try to preserve the original hierarchical structure where possible to maintain data organization and relationships.
- When working with collections, favor `/collections/{collectionName}/items` endpoints instead of accessing collections as blocks.

## Note for AI
When implementing functionality using this API, always make actual calls to these endpoints and verify the responses. Do not simulate or mock the API interactions or use hard-coded values on the client-side - use the real endpoints to ensure proper functionality and data handling.

**IMPORTANT: This is a production server connected to real user data.** Only perform testing operations that can be safely rolled back:

- Safe: Reading data (`GET` requests), creating test content that you delete immediately after
- Safe: Modifying content if you can restore it to its original state
- Safe: Moving blocks if you can move them back to their original position
- Unsafe: Permanent deletions, modifications without backup, or any changes you cannot reverse

Always verify rollback operations work before considering a test complete.

# Endpoints

# Fetch Blocks

`GET /blocks`

Fetches content from the document. The system uses a block-based hierarchical structure with rich content support. Page blocks define the hierarchy, where each page contains child blocks. The root level is itself a page block.

Use `Accept` header `application/json` for structured data, `text/markdown` for rendered content.

**Content Rendering:** Text blocks contain markdown formatting and may include structural tags like `<page></page>`, `<card></card>`, etc. When displaying content, consider rendering markdown as formatted text or cleaning up the syntax and structural tags for plain text display.

**Document Scope Filtering:** Block links in text runs are filtered to document scope. In-scope links include a `relation` field with the target blockId. Out-of-scope links include a `warning` string field instead.

**Tip:** Start by calling this endpoint without parameters to explore and understand the data structure before making modifications.

## Parameters

- **id** (query): string
  The ID of the page block to fetch. If not provided, the root page will be fetched.
- **maxDepth** (query): number
  The maximum depth of blocks to fetch. Default is -1 (all descendants). With a depth of 0, only the specified block is fetched. With a depth of 1, only direct children are returned.
- **fetchMetadata** (query): boolean
  Whether to fetch metadata (comments, createdBy, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedAt, createdAt) for the blocks. Default is false.

# Insert Blocks

`POST /blocks`

Insert content into the document. Content can be provided as structured JSON blocks. Returns the inserted blocks with their assigned block IDs for later reference. Block IDs never change once assigned.

**File Upload (3-Step Process)** – to upload files (images, videos, documents):
1. Call POST `/upload-link` with optional `fileName` or `mimeType` (e.g., `{"fileName": "photo.jpg"}`) to get `uploadUrl`
2. Upload file to S3 with matching Content-Type:
   ```bash
   curl -T /path/to/file "UPLOAD_URL" -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg"
   ```
3. Call POST `/blocks` with the uploaded file's URL as the block's `url` field
   - File metadata (`mimeType`, `fileSize`) will be automatically fetched from S3 and populated in the response
   - Do NOT provide `mimeType` or `fileSize` in the request - they are read-only fields

**S3 CLEANUP WARNING:**
Files uploaded to S3 that are NOT inserted into blocks within the timeout period will be automatically purged. Complete step 3 promptly.

**Content-Type Matching:**
The `Content-Type` header in step 2 must match the `mimeType` provided in step 1. If neither `mimeType` nor `fileName` is provided, defaults to `text/plain`.

**File Metadata:**
- `fileName`: Optional display name (e.g., `document.pdf`)
- `mimeType` and `fileSize`: Automatically retrieved from S3 and populated in the response

# Generate Upload URL

`POST /upload-link`

Generate a pre-signed S3 URL for direct file upload (Step 1 of 3-step upload process).

**3-Step Upload Flow:**
1. Call this endpoint with `fileName` (required) to get `uploadUrl`
2. Upload file to S3 with matching Content-Type:
   ```bash
   curl -T /path/to/file "UPLOAD_URL" -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg"
   ```
3. Call POST `/blocks` with the uploaded file's URL as the block's `url` field to insert the block

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- **`fileName` is REQUIRED** - Must provide the filename with extension (e.g., `photo.jpg`, `document.pdf`)
- Files uploaded to S3 must be inserted into blocks promptly or they will be purged
- The `uploadUrl` is valid for 1 hour
- MIME type is auto-detected from `fileName` extension (supports 40+ common file types)
- Optionally provide `mimeType` to override the auto-detected MIME type
- The `Content-Type` header in step 2 must match the `Content-Type` in the signed URL

## Request Body

**Content-Type:** `application/json`

```json
{
  "fileName": "photo.jpg",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
}
```
